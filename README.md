skt - sonic kernel testing
==========================

[![Travis CI Build Status][travis_badge]][travis_page]
[![Test Coverage Status][coveralls_badge]][coveralls_page]

Skt is a tool for automatically fetching, building, and testing kernel
patches published on Patchwork instances.

Dependencies
------------

Install dependencies needed for running skt like this:

    sudo dnf install -y python2 beaker-client

Dependencies needed to build kernels:

    sudo dnf install -y bison flex dnf-plugins-core
    sudo dnf builddep -y kernel-`uname -r`

Extra dependencies needed for running the testsuite:

    sudo dnf install -y python2-mock PyYAML

Run tests
---------

To run all tests execute:

    python -m unittest discover tests

To run some specific tests, you can execute a specific test like this:

    python -m unittest tests.test_publisher


Installation
------------

Install `skt` directly from git:

    pip install git+https://github.com/RH-FMK/skt

If support for beaker is required, install ``skt`` with the ``beaker``
extras:

    pip install git+https://github.com/rh-fmk/skt.git#egg-project[beaker]

Test the `skt` executable by printing the help text:

    skt -h

Usage
-----

The `skt` tool implements several "commands", and each of those accepts its
own command-line options and arguments. However there are also several
"global" command-line options, shared by all the commands. To get a summary of
the global options and available commands, run `skt --help`. To get a
summary of particular command's options and arguments, run `skt <COMMAND>
--help`, where `<COMMAND>` would be the command of interest.

Most of command-line options can also be read by `skt` from its configuration
file, which is `~/.sktrc` by default, but can also be specified using the
global `--rc` command-line option. However, there are some command-line
options which cannot be stored in the configuration file, and there are some
options read from the configuration file by some `skt` commands, which cannot
be passed via the command line. Some of the latter are required for operation.

Most `skt` commands can write their state to the configuration file as they
work, so that the other commands can take the workflow task over from them.
Some commands can receive that state from the command line, via options, but
some require some information stored in the configuration file. For this
reason, to support a complete workflow, it is necessary to always make the
commands transfer their state via the configuration file. That can be done by
passing the global `--state` option with every command.

To separate the actual configuration from the specific workflow's state, and
to prevent separate tasks from interfering with each other, you can store your
configuration in a separate (e.g. read-only) file, copy it to a new file each
time you want to do something, then discard the file after the task is
complete. Note that reusing a configuration file with state added can break
some commands in unexpected ways. That includes repeating a previous command
after the next command in the workflow has already ran.

The following commands are supported by `skt`:

* `merge`
    - Fetch a kernel repository, checkout particular references, and
      optionally apply patches from patchwork instances.
* `build`
    - Build the kernel with specified configuration and put it into a tarball.
      This command expects `merge` command to have completed succesfully.
* `publish`
    - Publish (copy) the kernel tarball, configuration, and build information
      to the specified location, generating their resulting URLs, using the
      specified "publisher". Only "cp", "scp", and "sftp" publishers are
      supported at the moment. This command expects `build` command to have
      completed succesfully.
* `run`
    - Run tests on a built kernel using the specified "runner". Only
      "Beaker" runner is currently supported. This command expects `publish`
      command to have completed succesfully.
* `report`
    - Report build and/or test results using the specified "reporter".
      Currently results can be reported by e-mail or printed to stdout. This
      command expects `run` command to have completed.
* `console-check`
    - Check the specified console logs for any traces, and report the first
      trace found for each console log.
* `all`
    - Run the following commands in order: `merge`, `build`, `publish`, `run`,
      `report` (if `--wait` option was specified).

The following is a walk through the process of checking out a kernel commit,
applying a patch from Patchwork, building the kernel, running the tests, and
reporting the results.

All the following commands use the `-vv` option to increase verbosity of the
command's output, so it's easier to debug problems. Remove the option for
quieter, shorter output.

### Merge

To checkout a kernel tree run:

    skt --rc <SKTRC> --state --workdir <WORKDIR> --output-dir <OUTDIR> -vv \
        merge --baserepo <REPO_URL> --ref <REPO_REF>

Here `<SKTRC>` would be the configuration file to retrieve the configuration
and the state from, and store the updated state in. `<WORKDIR>` would be the
directory to clone and checkout the kernel repo to, `<OUTDIR>` would be
directory to store output files, `<REPO_URL>` would be the source
kernel Git repo URL, and `<REPO_REF>` would be the reference to checkout.

E.g. to checkout "master" branch of the "net-next" repo:

    skt --rc skt-rc --state --workdir skt-workdir --output-dir skt-outdir -vv \
        merge --baserepo git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git \
              --ref master

To apply a patch from Patchwork run:

    skt --rc <SKTRC> --state --workdir <WORKDIR> -vv \
        merge --baserepo <REPO_URL> \
              --ref <REPO_REF> \
              --pw <PATCHWORK_PATCH_URL>

Here, `<REPO_REF>` would be the reference to checkout, and to apply the patch
on top of, and `<PATCHWORK_PATCH_URL>` would be the URL pointing to a patch on
a Patchwork instance.

E.g. to apply a particular patch to a particular, known-good commit from the
"net-next" repo, run:

    skt --rc skt-rc --state --workdir skt-workdir -vv \
        merge --baserepo git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git \
              --ref a870a02cc963de35452bbed932560ed69725c4f2 \
              --pw https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/886637

To apply a local patch run:

    skt --rc <SKTRC> --state --workdir <WORKDIR> -vv \
        merge --baserepo <REPO_URL> \
              --ref <REPO_REF> \
              --patch <PATH_TO_PATCH>

Here, `<PATH_TO_PATCH>` would be the patch file.
E.g. to apply a particular patch to a particular, known-good commit from the
"net-next" repo, run:

    skt --rc skt-rc --state --workdir skt-workdir -vv \
        merge --baserepo git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git \
              --ref a870a02cc963de35452bbed932560ed69725c4f2 \
              --patch net-next-cxgb4-notify-fatal-error-to-uld-drivers.patch

#### Faster clones

In some instances, a full git history is not needed. Shallow clones are git
repositories that have a truncated history and they can be cloned much faster
than a full copy of the repository. Use the `--fetch-depth` option with
`skt merge`:

    skt ... merge ... --fetch-depth 5

In the example above, the repository will be cloned with a git history of five
commits. This speeds up the cloning process, but it also prevents the use of
any git references (tags, branches, etc) that were made before the last five
commits.

### Build

And to build the kernel run:

    skt --rc <SKTRC> --state --workdir <WORKDIR> -vv \
        build -c `<CONFIG_FILE>`

Where `<CONFIG_FILE>` would be the kernel configuration file to build the
kernel with. The configuration will be applied with `make olddefconfig`, by
default.

E.g. to build with the current system's config file run:

    skt --rc skt-rc --state --workdir skt-workdir -vv \
        build -c /boot/config-`uname -r`

**NOTE:** Kernels are built without debuginfo by default to save disk space
and improve build times. In some cases, deep troubleshooting may require
debug symbols. Use the `--enable-debuginfo` argument to build a kernel with
debug symbols included.

Provide additional arguments and options to `make` by using
`--makeopts`.

#### Kernel configuration file options

Three kernel configuration file options are supported by `skt`:

* Provide a kernel configuration file directly: `--config CONFIG_FILE_PATH`
* Use a minimal configuration for a very small kernel: `--cfgtype tinyconfig`
* Build kernel configuration files for Red Hat kernels: `--cfgtype rh-configs`

Users must specify a filename glob using `--rh-configs-glob` with
`--cfgtype rh-configs`. This allows `skt` to choose the correct kernel
configuration file. The path should be relative to the path of the kernel
source.

The following example works for `x86_64`:

    --rh-configs-glob "redhat/configs/kernel-*-x86_64.config"

The following example works for POWER systems (little endian):

    --rh-configs-glob "redhat/configs/kernel-*-ppc64le.config"

### Publish

To "publish" the resulting build using the simple "cp" (copy) publisher run:

    skt --rc <SKTRC> --state --workdir <WORKDIR> -vv \
        publish -p cp <DIRECTORY> <URL_PREFIX>

Here `<DIRECTORY>` would be the location for the copied build artifacts, and
`URL_PREFIX` would be the string to add to prepend the filenames with
(together with a slash `/`) to construct the URLs the files will be reachable
at. The resulting URLs will be passed to other commands, such as `run`, via
the saved state in the configuration file.

E.g. to publish to the `/srv/builds` directory available at
`http://skt-server` run:

    skt --rc skt-rc --state --workdir skt-workdir -vv \
        publish -p cp /srv/builds http://skt-server

### Run

To run the tests you will need access to a
[Beaker](https://beaker-project.org/) instance configured to the point where
`bkr whoami` completes successfully. You will also need a template file for
generating a Beaker job XML, which runs the tests. The template file can
contain the following placeholder strings replaced by `skt` before submitting
the job XML to Beaker:

* `##KVER##`
    - The kernel release version output by `make -s kernelrelease`.
* `##KPKG_URL##`
    - The URL of the kernel tarball, generated and published to with
      `publish`.

Below is an example of a superficial template. Note that it won't work as is.

```XML
<job>
  <whiteboard>skt ##KVER##</whiteboard>
  <recipeSet>
    <recipe whiteboard="##KVER##">
      <distroRequires>
        <and>
          <distro_family op="=" value="Fedora26"/>
          <distro_tag op="=" value="RELEASED"/>
          <distro_variant op="=" value="Server"/>
          <distro_arch op="=" value="x86_64"/>
        </and>
      </distroRequires>
      <hostRequires>
        <and>
          <arch op="=" value="x86_64"/>
        </and>
      </hostRequires>
      <repos/>
      <partitions/>
      <ks_appends/>
      <task name="/distribution/install" role="STANDALONE"/>
      <task name="/distribution/kpkginstall" role="STANDALONE">
        <params>
          <param name="KPKG_URL" value="##KPKG_URL##"/>
          <param name="KVER" value="##KVER##"/>
        </params>
      </task>
    </recipe>
  </recipeSet>
</job>
```

Provided you have both Beaker access and a suitable job XML template, you can
run the tests with the built kernel as such:

    skt --rc <SKTRC> --state --workdir <WORKDIR> -vv run \
        --runner beaker '{"jobtemplate": "<JOBTEMPLATE>"}' \
        --wait

Here, `<JOBTEMPLATE>` would be the name of the file with the Beaker job XML
template. If you remove the `--wait` option, the command will return once the
job was submitted. Otherwise it will wait for its completion and report the
result.

In case running on specific hosts is not desired, one can use a simple text
file containing one hostname per line, and pass the file via `blacklist`
parameter. Tests will not attempt to run on machines which names are specified
in the file. This is useful for example as a temporary fix in case the hardware
is buggy and the maintainer of the pool doesn't have time to exclude it from
the pool.

E.g. to run the tests from a job XML template named `beakerjob.xml` and exclude
machines in `blacklist.txt` file execute:

    skt --rc skt-rc --state --workdir skt-workdir -vv run \
        --runner beaker '{"jobtemplate": "beakerjob.xml", \
	                  "blacklist": "blacklist.txt"}, \
        --wait

### Report

There are two "reporters" supported at the moment: "stdio" and "mail".
The former prints the report on stdout and the latter sends it by mail to
specified addresses, with specified "From" address.

This command *requires* the runner parameters from the "run" command to be
present in the configuration file. It needs this minimum "runner" section:

    [runner]
    type = beaker
    jobtemplate = <JOBTEMPLATE>

Here, `<JOBTEMPLATE>` is the same Beaker job template file name you used for
the "run" command. E.g., continuing from the example above, it can be:

    [runner]
    type = beaker
    jobtemplate = beakerjob.xml

#### stdio Reporter

The `stdio` reporter prints the report to stdout and requires no additional
options:

    skt --rc <SKTRC> --state --workdir <WORKDIR> -vv \
        report --reporter stdio

#### mail Reporter

The `mail` reporter sends an email to one or more recipients with the results
of the testing. Multiple options are available:

* `--mail-to`: one or more recipient email addresses *(required)*
* `--mail-from`: the email address of the sender *(required)*
* `--mail-subject`: the email subject *(optional)*
* `--mail-header`: one or more email headers to add to the email *(optional)*

The most basic email report can be sent using these arguments:

    skt --rc skt-rc --state --workdir skt-workdir -vv \
        report --reporter mail \
        --mail-to developer@example.com \
        --mail-from skt@example.com

Multiple recipient addresses can be provided:

    skt --rc skt-rc --state --workdir skt-workdir -vv \
        report --reporter mail \
        --mail-to developer@example.com --mail-to dev2@example.com \
        --mail-from skt@example.com

Here is a full example with multiple email headers:

    skt --rc skt-rc --state --workdir skt-workdir -vv \
        report --reporter mail \
        --mail-to developer@example.com dev2@example.com \
        --mail-from skt@example.com \
        --mail-subject "Important tests results" \
        --mail-header "X-Build-ID: 225" \
        --mail-header "In-Reply-To: <messageid@example.com>"

The `reporter` command is able to send a single report for multiple test
runs. For now, only runs with same patch series and base are supported. This
is especially useful if the same patch series are being tested on multiple
architectures. To run reporter in multireport mode, add the `--result` option
with an skt state file created by the `run` command you wish to report. The
`--result` option can be repeated multiple times for multiple state files.

Using the previous example of mail report command and state files
`./state_x86` and `./state_s390x`, the command will be:

    skt --rc skt-rc --state --workdir skt-workdir -vv \
        report --reporter mail \
        --mail-to developer@example.com --mail-to dev2@example.com \
        --mail-from skt@example.com \
        --result ./state_x86 --result ./state_s390x

### Console check

The console checker is not a part of the default flow, but allows parsing
console logs to detect any call traces. A kernel release string is needed (can
be grabbed from state file), and URL or file path to one or more console logs
can be specified. Local files can be gzipped.

Example of the command to check console log present at given URL, when the
kernel release string is parsed out of state file:

    skt --rc skt-rc --state --workdir skt-workdir -vv \
        console-check --console http://beaker.example.com/skt-logs/console.log

Developer Guide
---------------

Developers can test changes to `skt` by using "development mode" from python's
`setuptools` package. First, `cd` to the directory where `skt` is cloned and
run:

    pip install --user -e .

This installs `skt` in a mode where any changes within the repo are
immediately available simply by running `skt`. There is no need to repeatedly
run `pip install .` after each change.

Using a virtual environment is highly recommended. This keeps `skt` and all
its dependencies in a separate Python environment. Developers can build a
virtual environment for skt quickly:

    virtualenv ~/skt-venv/
    source ~/skt-venv/bin/activate
    pip install -e .

To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run `deactivate`.
